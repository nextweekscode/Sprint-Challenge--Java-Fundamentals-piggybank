//    1. JOO was used in order to create a "coin"
//        class that holds all the attributes to create a all the coin objects we want, as well as to manage each of those
//                objects individually
//        Each individual coin object inherits the needed fields and methods from the parent
//            2. javac app/*.java - this steps compiles all the .java files and converts them into
//            byte code as well as a .class file
//            jar cvfe appapp.jar app.Main app/*.class - this step takes all the .class files within the
//            and condenses them down into a .jar file that will use to later run the app, we are taking
//            advantage of cvfe c - creating a new archive v generating verbose output f specific the jar
//            output file to be created and e set the main class aldo called the entrypoint
//
//            3.Javas strong typed nature requires us as developers to always specifiy the type for each
//            variable field or method in a java app. In the case of this project, the coinid would an int, name and
//            plural name are Strings, value is a double (because we are working with money) and quanity is an int.
//
//            4.
//            Abstract calsses containt fiels, while interfaces should not. Interfaces generally only share a
//            header but not any specific implementation details. Spring appears to primarly rely on interfaces
//            while still needing abstract classes, i used an interface by the name of coinrepository in this project.
